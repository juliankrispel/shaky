# Shaky - a Configurable React UI framework
Shaky will be a modular, lightweight - completely configurable UI framework. It's style agnostic, you can use inline styles or classnames, or mix the two.

To provide feedback and suggestions, create a [new issue](issues/new) here - All ideas welcome (at this point).
